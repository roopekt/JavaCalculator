# Java Calculator 

Right now this just prints hello world, but in the future this will be a calculator. This is my first attempt at test driven development.

## Installation 

1. Install IntelliJ IDEA  
  https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download
2. Clone the project
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/roopekt/JavaCalculator.git
  ```
3. Make sure you have lombok installed. With new enough editor, this should be installed by default.
